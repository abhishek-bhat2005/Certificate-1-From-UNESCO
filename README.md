I am honored to have received the UNESCO MGIEP certificate, a significant milestone in my educational journey. This program has enriched my understanding of global citizenship education and social-emotional learning. I deeply appreciate the dedication and support of the organizers and instructors, whose guidance made this achievement possible. I look forward to applying the knowledge gained to contribute to positive change in society.
